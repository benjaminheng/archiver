# Archiver

This program walks through a directory of markdown files, finds links in each
file, and tries to archive the web content. Links are processed using a
[Readability-style preprocessor](https://ejucovy.github.io/readability/) before
being archived.

This program is used to archive linked URLs in my knowledge base for posterity.
The generated link archive can be found at
[github.com/benjaminheng/link-archive](https://github.com/benjaminheng/link-archive).
